## Innovation Summary

This project introduces a novel privacy-preserving bridge between healthcare and insurance by enabling encrypted AI-based claim validation. Unlike traditional systems that require sharing sensitive patient data, this solution operates entirely on encrypted embeddings using CyborgDB-style encryption-in-use. It enables accurate fraud detection, cost validation, and compliance without ever exposing PHI—unlocking secure cross-industry collaboration for the first time.
